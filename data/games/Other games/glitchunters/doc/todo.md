# Stuff to implement
+ ~~top walls should be rendered over the player~~ (done)
+ ~~player sprite should be mirrored~~
+ ~~player direction should be given by the cursor direction~~
+ ~~player should fire projectiles into the cursor direction~~
+ ~~projectiles should be rotated properly~~
+ ~~projectiles should have blowing up animation~~
+ ~~player should slide along the wall on tilted movement~~
+ ~~sum action-applied forces(acc) together then normalize for player~~
+ ~~handle bullet collision w/ glichez~~
+ ~~player-locked camera movement causes invalid mouseCoords values~~
+ ~~healthbar~~
+ ~~there should be NPC mobs~~
+ ~~mapGen should create trees around border~~
+ ~~add shadow for flying (z+) entities (e.g. bullets)~~
+ ~~tp should have a cooldown~~
+ ~~tp should stay inside bounds~~
- 8-bit like music should be playing
- 8-bit like effects should be playing

# Stuff to figure out
- glitch power up possibilities
+ ~~story / intro~~
+ ~~level progress~~
- jsfxr license should be preserved i guess

# Random extra ideas
- glich portal (/ huge-glitch) as enemy, which spawns normal glichez
- special fire (grenades or somethin) on RMB, which could create exploisions
