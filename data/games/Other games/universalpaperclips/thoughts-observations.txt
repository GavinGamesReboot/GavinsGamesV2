So the first pass, at two column (early game), it looks good.

But, I realized, playing at night in "darkroom" (inverted white/black)
mode, text is readable when it is white on black. But the projects,
with a grey background and faint text is not readable.

That's something to work on next -- making the colors better in more cases.
