Compact Conflict
================

A minuscule risk-based strategy game created for [JS13k 2014](http://js13kgames.com/). Less than 13kB minified and zipped.

You can **[play it right here](http://wasyl.eu/games/compact-conflict/play.html)**.

#### The code

All the magic happens in `erisk.js` and `index.html`. 

If you want to build your own minified versions, `build.sh` can hook you up, but it needs the following installed:

* uglifyjs
* htmlminifier

Both are modules on **npm**.

#### Thanks

Thanks go to:

* Krzysztof Kula, for getting me to try JS13k, and for quality feedback throughout.
* Adam Kwapi≈Ñski and Tomasz Bylina for invaluable gameplay testing sessions.
* All the kind folks at [Schibsted Tech Polska](http://schibsted.pl/) who tested the game!
